---------------------------SUDOKU GAME------------------------------
   
   This project was developed as part of the Applied Programming (PA) course within the FACE program at the University of Craiova (http://ace.ucv.ro/). It is a game that offers varying levels of difficulty—from Easy to Hard—and includes a special level featuring a 4x4 grid layout.

   Key features include:
Difficulty Levels: Choose from multiple challenge levels, including a compact 4x4 grid mode.

Note-Taking Mode: Toggle note-taking functionality with the ‘N’ key, allowing players to jot down potential moves.

Mistake Limit Settings: Customize the number of mistakes allowed before the game starts.

Extra Chances: Option to purchase additional mistake allowances to continue playing.

Inactivity Reminder: If you’ve been idle for over an hour, the game will send you a WhatsApp reminder encouraging you to come back and play.

   It’s a fun and flexible game tailored to your preferences—you can reset the grid as often as you like, play casually without worrying about mistakes, or push yourself in a high-stakes mode with no resets and no mistakes allowed.
